# hodgkin lymphoma scRNAseq analysis

Citation of the publication: Coming soon.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of CD3+ and CD3- peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 20 patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) cHL who were treated with single-agent PD-1 blockade (nivolumab) at baseline (cycle 1 day 1 [C1D1]) and on therapy (cycle 4 day 1 [C4D1]). These samples were annotated for the patientsâ€™ best overall response to PD-1 blockade: complete response (CR), 9 pts; partial response (PR), 5 pts; and progressive disease (PD), 6 pts. PBMCs from 11 patients with newly diagnosed (ND), previously untreated cHL and 13 control healthy donors (HD) were similarly sequenced.


The scripts used to generate the figures are in the `scripts` folder.

The `src` folder contains some helper functions.

The `data` folder contains the BCR called from `TRUST4` and TCR data from 10x vdj experiment.
